# Analysis_from_raw_counts

Raw expression counts from six Arabidopsis samples belonging two experimental groups (stress: STR and control: CTRL). 

This analysis starts from a counts.txt file and is divided into 5 parts:

1- Clustering of the samples
2- Differential expression analysis
3- Heatmap
4- Volcano Plot
5- Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis
